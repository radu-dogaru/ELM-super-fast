# ELM-super-fast
Python implementation of ELM - with optimized speed on MKL-based platforms; Described in conference paper: Radu Dogaru, Ioana Dogaru, "Optimization of extreme learning machines for big data applications using Python", COMM-2018
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8484265

ADVANTAGES: 
- allows quantization of input layer weights (in many cases 2 bits are enough) 
- allows quantization of output layer weights (in many cases 8 bits are enough)
- gives very good accuracies with tip=3 (absolute value) hidden layer 
Well suited for HW and other rezource-constrained machine learning implementations
